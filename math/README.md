# Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving With the MATH Dataset
This folder is modified based on [MATH repo](https://github.com/hendrycks/math).

This repository contains dataset loaders and evaluation code. Dataset is downloaded in `modeling`. To prepare the data, unzip `modeling/MATH.zip`

# Evaluate GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4

Run `python modeling/eval_math_chatgpt.py`

# Evaluate AutoGen

Run `python modeling/eval_math_autogen.py`
